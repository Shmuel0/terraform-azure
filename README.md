# Provisioning of an Azure VM with terraform 

The main idea of this project is to provision and deploy a remote web development environment in Azure cloud available via secure tunneling, with terraform as the IaaS tool, and VS code CLI as the code editor inside the remote machine. All is based on the FreeCodeCamp video that is shown at the end of this file, the changes made where to eliminate the need to use SSH, by enabling the secure tunneling when the machine is deployed eliminating the need to log in the remote via SSH to activate the secure tunnel, allowing the user to only use its github credentials on any visual Studio code instance to use their remote environment.
